#Weather App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a weather application that uses an API from AccuWeather to get the weather conditions (temperature, rainy/sunny/cloudy/snowy, night-time/daytime, etc.) of a searched city. If a city name is not spelled correctly/doesn't exist, an error message is given. Unfortunately, the API only grants 50 requests per day.
